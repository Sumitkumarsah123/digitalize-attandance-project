# digitize-attendance-system
This "digitize-attendance-system" is my first group project experience. we used C++ as a programming language.
it is desktop application which can be used by teacher and student.
The main objective of this is project is to provide the platform where teacher can hold the record of each students along with their academic performance. Also Teacher can upload assignments and important notice.
We used MySql as a database and Visual Studio to write the code
